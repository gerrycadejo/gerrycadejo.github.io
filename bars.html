    <h2 class="cs-title"> Why am I showing this?</h2>
    <p class="text-justify port-explain">
      <i>
      To give some context, I started coding a year ago and I never
      expected that this would become my creative outlet. I found
      that working in projects like this is a way to express who I
      am and the unimportant things that are important to me. <br> <br>

      That being said, I'm showing this project because it is my
      firstborn and more importantly because it represents 4 months
      of consolidating my understanding of coding, dealing with frustration
      and creative block, and developing a detail-minded approach.
    </i>
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs-title">The Pre-Process</h2>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    The project's criteria was the following: it should be simple and beautiful.
    I had no idea how to build a site, much less how to make it simple. So I
    figured out that I should start with a wireframe in order to remove
    all non essential parts.
    </p>
    <!--<h2 class="cs-title">The Wireframe</h2>-->
    <img src="barwire.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

    <p class="text-justify port-text" style="margin-top: 4%;">
    By the end of this stage, I felt happy that I had a simple
    project and I was relieved that apparently it was going to take me no
    time to finish it. (yey)</p>
    <h2 class="cs-title">The Actual Process</h2>

    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    Obviously, it did not happen like I thought it would. Once I started,
    it suddenly hit me that my understanding of coding was basic and for that reason,
    I needed to do some research and learn new skills.</p>

    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    First, I did an online course on Google Maps API that taught me
    its limitations and helped me define what else I needed to learn.
    Then and during the whole project, I relied on FreeCodeCamp and visited every
    Stack Overflow question with the "google maps" tag on it. This felt endless, although as I kept
    learning, every small progress felt like being on the first row of a
    Toto concert.

    <h2 class="cs-title" style="margin-top:4%">The Concept</h2>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    After "finishing" with the functionalities, I began working with
    the concept. My first idea was to call it "Beers under 40" but after
    searching it on google I knew I was not the first person to had that
    in mind. Then, I went inwards and I realized that what I really like about
    having beers is the uncertainty of what happens after you take your first
    sip. Hence, I called the site "Priceless Bars".
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify port-text" style="margin-top:4%">
    The design was a whole journey on its own. Getting the right palette
    and consolidating shapes, borders, and typography took me forever.
    Not to mention that I needed to start working on the content.
    It was a slow and iterative process that required me often to go
    back and change the interactions for the design and vice-versa.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    It took me 3 months to get this result:

    <ul class="list">
      <li>
      I need to display the device orientation.
      The GPS takes a while to update its position
      so it is hard to tell where are you walking towards.
      </li>
      <li>
      When it comes to "side projects", a clear structure and a calendar are not "one-more-episode-proof",
      much less "I don't know what to write, perhaps I'm not made for this"-resistant.
