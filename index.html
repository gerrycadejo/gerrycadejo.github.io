    I used to write plays when I was in high school.
    I remember writing for hours, reading it out loud, editing, laughing
    and then fantasizing about the opening show. Even though, me and my plays got butchered everytime by the
    school <a href="#"  rel="tooltip"  class="clickable" title="Damn you Pablo!">critique</a>,
    it was really fun and in a way, these were my
    firsts tries as a writer.<br>
    </p>
  <p class=" text-justify story">
    Back then, all I was certain of was that I liked going stupid and me
    and my highschool sweetheart were gonna stay together forever.
    I was 17 at the time, the world was mine and failure was not even on my
    <a href="#" class="clickable"  rel="tooltip" title="Nor did my first breakup">radar.</a>
  </p>
    <p class=" text-justify story">
    I was all about the fancy job titles, academic achievements and serious adults matters.
    Now, I see I was just a boy, completely unaware that 10+ years later I was gonna
    trade the academic life for free-spirited experiences and have
    "telling stories" as one of my main skills.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story one">
    I couldn't have possibly guessed that a day like today I would call myself
    a creative and do serious adult kind of work without losing my
    own stupid touch. For example <a href="apple.html" style="color:black"><span class="work" id="header">Apple TV Bites.</span></a>

      Eventually, it was time to make a decision and after giving it no thought and discussing it with everyone,
      I decided to go to med school.
      Partly because I grew up watching George Clooney as a doctor, but
      mainly cause I believed that only then I could change the

      <br>
      </p>
    <p class=" text-justify story">
      I had the drive to make it happen and my mother made sure I had the whitest doctor's coat ever.
      They both remained neat, until
      the day I encountered the wonders and horrors of a real human body. Needless to say, it was the end of

      After med school, I tried a different approach and
      I chose to do something I kind of liked, in this case creating videos.
      So I went with marketing.</p>
    <p class="text-justify story">
      At the beginning it felt a little bit
      heartless, using words like "suppliers" and reading Kotler's books.
      However, as I dived deeper into it, I was introduced to the power of ideas
      and how they can change a whole society.

      Until today, I still get thrilled by thinking of this, I
      still have a strong impulse to do good, to create for a
      greater cause. I have an impulse to change what I think
      needs to be changed: exhibit A <a href="nintendo.html" style="color:black"><span class="work">Nintendo Labo. </span></a>

  <p class="text-justify story">
    Time passed and I finished my bachelor in Marketing.
    Even then I could tell that I'd made a very good decision.
    I enjoyed working with it, I had a purpose to work
    with it and honestly I did not suck at it.   <br>
    </p>
  <p class=" text-justify story">
    Especially, I liked the fact that it allowed me to be my fullest version
    of myself. Everything I've lived before, the things that I've cared
    for, the shows that I've<a href="#"  rel="tooltip"  class="clickable" title="Especially Friends S9"> watched</a>, it all helped me become a better
    professional, to take my peculiarity and from it, connect
    with the world.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story">
    People who knew me at my early stages, could
    often described me as an idiot on fire, due to my overall lack of
    understanding and my eagerness to make things work and make them work good.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story">
    Today, I know more than I did before and I think people's perception
    of me has <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target=".bd-example-modal-lg-2" class="clickable">
    changed</a>, even though I don't mind having this
    tag around me. Sometimes you start an expert, others you don't.
    That's business and there are many beginnings in between briefs, brands and industries.

    It's a learning process, where curiosity will get yourself
    up in flames and help you endure error after error, until you'll no longer
    an idiot. At least, until the next starting line shows up. That's how

  It's always been hard to explain what I do to friends and family.
  It was hard when I was a media planner, a little less confusing
  as a copywriter and too damn abstract when I worked as a digital
  creative. <br>

<p class=" text-justify story">

<p class="text-justify story">
The problem is, they are neglecting the process and even worst they're missing
the other 10% of the work. The great work, the "it made me cry" kind of work,
the one that brings some sunlight into one's lonely soul. Thankfully, I was lucky
enough to have <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target=".bd-example-modal-lg-4" class="clickable">mentors</a>
that guided me and encouraged me to always go after this type of work. Moreover, they even trusted me to have the resilience to

  In Guatemala, kindness is at every corner. You'll find it when strangers
  greet you inside a lift, when food keeps filling your plate
  (especially after you're done) and in the eyes of people you accidentally meet while walking down
  the streets.

 Nonetheless, as much as I loved my yard, moving to Stockholm was not as hard as I thought it
 would be. Fika is great, jalapenos are cheap and I've met lovely
 people whom I truly admire.
</p>
<p class="text-justify story">
  Though, I need to say that during my first weeks here and checking
  out the beer prices, I thought of swimming my way back to Guatemala.
  I love beer and as I said before, I like creating things that contribute to the overall
  wellbeing of humankind, so with that in mind, I created this:<a href="bars.html" style="color:black;"><span class="work">Priceless bars.</span></a>

  I arrived in Stockholm a year ago and Hyper Island is the reason behind it.
  Here I found a different side of my passions, I won my first <a href="ica.html" style="color:black;"><span class="work" id="header">hackathon</span></a>,
  increased my list of "things I know I don't know"  and failed graciously
  in projects with outstanding people by my side. It's at Hyper,
  that I feel almost in the same place that I was 10+ years ago. Restless and busy cracking up my future,
  but overall excited about what's coming next. <br>
  </p>
<p class=" text-justify story">
  Hyper it's the most recent chapter of my life and I'm still working on the plot.
  Looking back, I'm  very grateful for the journey that brought me here
  and all of its invaluable <a href="#"  rel="tooltip"  class="clickable" title="Kebab Pizza can't be unseen">lessons</a>.
  Even though I have not learned how
  to foreseen the <a href="#"  rel="tooltip"  class="clickable" title="Oh... But I will!">future</a>, I can easily see myself
  immersed in ideas and finding solutions with a 10k HD smile on my face.
  </p>
<p class="text-justify story">
  Hopefully, once I've lived my next chapters you can read that I'm working with tech, stories and strategy.
  Perhaps and I'm crossing fingers, my next chapter starts with the time you helped me land an intership
  as a creative technologist.
