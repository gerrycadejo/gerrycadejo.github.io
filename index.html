  <p class="text-justify story">
    I used to write plays when I was in high school.
    I remember writing for hours, reading it out loud, editing, laughing
    and then fantasizing about the opening show.  It was really fun
    and I was just a boy. And like any teenager, I was oblivious of what I
    could do or what I was wishful to do as a grown-up. <br>
    </p>
  <p class=" text-justify story">
    I liked telling jokes, I liked unleashing my stupidity, but I knew
    nothing about creativity as a career path. I was all about the
    fancy job titles, academic achievements and serious adults matters.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story">
  I was just a boy, completely unaware that 10+ years later I was gonna
  trade the academic life for free-spirited experiences and have
  "telling stories" as one of my main skills.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story">
    I couldn't have guessed that a day like today I would call myself
    a creative and do serious adult kind of work without losing my
    own stupid touch. For example <span class="work">Apple TV Bites. </span>
  </p>

    <h1> 2 </h1>
    <p class="text-justify story">
      When it was time to make a call, I decided to go to med school.
      Partly because I grew up watching George Clooney as a doctor, but
      mainly cause I believed that only then I could change the world.
      <br>
      </p>
    <p class=" text-justify story">
      I had the drive and it lasted until I encountered the wonders
      and horrors of the human body. Needless to say, it was the end of
      paging dr. Gerry. </p>
    <p class="text-justify story">
      After med school, I tried a different approach and
      I chose to do something I kind of liked, in this case creating videos.
      So I went with marketing.</p>
    <p class="text-justify story">
      At the beginning it felt a little bit
      heartless, using words like "suppliers" and reading Kotler's books.
      However, as I dived deeper into it, I was introduced to the power of ideas
      and how they can change a whole society.

      Until today, I still get thrilled by thinking of this, I
      still have a strong impulse to do good, to create for a
      greater cause. I have an impulse to change what I think
      needs to be changed: exhibit A <span class="work">Nintendo Labo. </span>
    </p>
  </div> <!-- section -->
  <div class="col-12 section">
  <h1> 3 </h1>
  <p class="text-justify story">
    Time passed and I finished my bachelor in Marketing.
    Even then I could tell that I've made the best decision I
    could. I enjoyed working with it, I had a purpose to work
    with it and honestly I did not suck at it.   <br>
    </p>
  <p class=" text-justify story">
    Especially, I liked the fact that it allowed me to be my fullest version
    of myself. Everything I've lived before, the things I've cared
    for, the shows I've watched, it all helped me to become a better
    professional, to take my peculiarity and from it, connect
    with the world.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story">
    People who knew me at my early stages, could
    often described me as an idiot on fire. I had no clue about
    what I was doing but I had the will to make things work and
    make them good.
  </p>
  <p class="text-justify story">
    Today I'd like to think people's perception
    of me has changed, even though I don't mind having this
    "idiot" aura around me. I mean, every new brief it's a learning
    process, where if you are curious enough you'll get yourself
    caught up in flames and after a few errors, you'll no longer be
    an idiot(at least until the next brief comes around). That's how
    I felt with this project: <span class="work"> Coutts.</span>

<h1> 4 </h1>
<p class="text-justify story">
  It's always been hard to explain what I do to friends and family.
  It was hard when I was a media planner, a little less confusing
  as a copywriter and too damn abstract when I worked as a digital
  creative. <br>
  </p>
<p class=" text-justify story">
  Also, even if they had a more or less clear idea about
  what I did, I had this constant suspicion that they all assume
  none of these roles involve hard work.
</p>
<p class="text-justify story">
  I can't blame them, where I come from not only would you find ads
  everywhere, but 90% of them might kill you if you stare for too
  long. Most of these, are packed with lame puns and flashy colors,
  like how hard could it be to create them?</p>
<p class="text-justify story">
What they're missing is the other 10% of the work, the one that sticks,
the one that brings some sunlight into one's lonely soul. I was lucky
enough to have mentors that guided me towards striving to create this
type of work. Moreover, they even trusted me to have the resilience to
be part of their projects. For instance: <span class="work">Chamba Billboards.</span>

<p class="text-justify story">
  My story would not be complete without telling you about my home
  country: Guatemala. I've lived there for almost my whole life and
  I've formed my identity around loud noises, warm people, tropic
  weather and never-ending surrealism. <br>
  </p>
<p class=" text-justify story">
  There, the reality is harsh and negativity is not an option,
  therefore kindness is at every corner. You'll find it when strangers
  greet you inside a lift, when food keeps filling your plate
  (especially after you're done) and in the eyes of people you accidentally meet while walking down
  the streets.
</p>
<p class="text-justify story">
 Moving to Stockholm was not as hard as I thought it
 would be. Fika is great, jalapenos are cheap and I've met lovely
 people whom I truly admire.
</p>
<p class="text-justify story">
  Though during my first weeks here, I thought of swimming my way back to Guatemala after checking out
  the prices of beers. As I said before, I like creating things
  that contribute to the overall wellbeing of humankind, so with
  that in mind, I created this: <span class="work">Priceless bars.</span>

<p class="text-justify story">
  Hyper Island is the reason why I'm living in Stockholm.
  Here I found my new creative outlet with coding, learned
  about processes that foster creativity and failed graciously
  in projects with outstanding people by my side. It's at Hyper,
  that I feel almost in the same place I was 10+ years ago, cracking up my future
  and excited about what's next. <br>
  </p>
<p class=" text-justify story">
  This is as far as my story gets, but how about some spoilers?
  Right now I'd love to keep working with ideas, in the role of a
  creative technologist.
</p>
<p class="text-justify story">
  Although, any other title will do. As long as I have:
  tech, stories, and strategy at the core of
  what I do, It'll be alright. I mean, my folks won't know
  what I do anyway.
