      <i>With this project, I'm very happy about the planning
      process that we had and how we pushed ourselves to go from a simple
      insight into an unorthodox solution. Also, this project
      combines the three areas I'm more keen to work with:
      tech, stories, and strategy. Not to mention that we
      won the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.icagruppen.se/karriar/karriarnytt/hyper-island-i-hackathon-med-ica-en-kreativ-fulltraff/">hackathon.</i></a>

      ICA offers jobs for all kind of people at different
      stages of their life and while this is good for their
      diversity goals, it represented a challenge for us since
      we could've not met all of their audience's needs.
      Therefore, our first decision was to only target students
      looking for an entry-level position.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    Once we settled that piece, we defined our question:
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">
    <i>How might we help ICA become the most attractive employer
    for our target group?</i>
    </h3>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    After some research and discussion,
    we discovered that the usual recruitment process
    is filled with confusing job titles and general
    roles descriptions, making it hard to understand
    if this job offer is aligned with the things you
    are passionate about</p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    We had our insight and we knew how hard ICA works
    to have a culture of professional growth and development,
    that's why we created <i>ICAN</i>.
    An application process camouflaged as an interactive video
    that portraits ICA as the place where you <i>CAN</i> have a
    meaningful career based on the things that you care for.

      <li>Our solution disrupted the norm of application processes, where instead of choosing a job
        you were selecting the things you enjoy. The format we'd chosen
        allowed us to convey how easy it was to do what you love in a casual day at ICA and how their
        work culture manifests itself in even the smallest interaction. </li>

      <li>Now, I think our solution had a short lifespan and it's hard
        to scale, perhaps it was smarter to separate it from their website and
        use it only as a gimmick at job fairs or at school visits. </li>
