    <h2 class="cs-title"> Why am I showing this?</h2>
    <p class="text-justify port-explain">
      <i>This project was made by intuition and google searches. It challenged me
        to fill my knowledge gap with imagination and stubbornness. It was a process of
        thinking, testing, scratching and starting again.</i>
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs-title">The Process</h2>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
      For this project, we kind of needed to craft our own brief and Nitin
      and I decided to put a pin on saving the world and instead we tried finding
      opportunities within everyday problems. That's why we went with a common burden
      of ours, how to decide what to eat?<br><br>

      We discovered that it's easier to make decisions when you have been craving
      a meal and we both agreed that the biggest craving factory out there was Netflix.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    It was a silly insight(ish) but still it helped us frame our main question:
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">
    <i> What if we can make easier food-related-decisions
      by watching more shows?</i>
    </h3>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    We realized that there were new playes in the streaming industry and
    that a physical deviced would make things easier. With this in mind, we
    went with Apple TV instead of Netflix.
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    We did the simplest user journey we could think of and after a while,
    we selected computer vision and eye tracking technology as our main
    ingredients. We had something, but our recipee was still missing accuracy and it stayed
    like that, until the vital radio technology came in.<br> <br>

    We went through many rabbit holes but in the end, we managed to come up with this:

    <h2 class="cs-title">The Idea</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="col-12 sec">
    <h2 class="cs-title">Why we went with this idea</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>We liked this idea because even though it sounded
        extremely complicated it always felt feasible. The business
        opportunities around Apple's streaming service and the Apple
        Wallet encouraged us to continue until the end. Also, it had that
        vibe of practically using magic to solve a common problem.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="cs-title">What I would've done differently</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>I think that we focused too much on new technologies
        instead of going for a more elegant solution with the existing
        Apple products. For instance, was it easier to use
        the Apple Watch's ECG instead of vital radio waves?
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, I think the case study could have gone beyond the binge-watching
        moment and explored new interactions. (i.e. Asking Siri your cravings at
        a food court)
