      <i>This project taught me a lot about the copywriting craft
        and the process of making ideas happen.
        This project pushed my limits and helped me build a thick skin
        and a resilient attitude. Also, it was shorlisted at Cannes.

      Two months after I started working for the first time as a copywriter,
      I was presented with this project, and even without having any knowledge
      about what's good and what's bad, I could tell this one was special.
      <br><br>
      Long story short, the idea was a hit. The client, my coworkers and agencies
      from the Leo Burnett network, they all loved it and I was happy for it,
      but little did I know that it was just the beginning.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify port-text">
      At that time, my main responsability became writing the script
      for the case study. Looking back, I think of this period as a
      script-writing bootcamp; I wrote many drafts, harrased people for
      feedback and iterate upon their inputs.
     </p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    Later in the process, they put me in contact with Jason Soy, senior copywriter at
    LB Toronto, and he pretty much told me my script sucked. Following his advice and after
    many drafts, I found an angle with a human story and a clear antagonist.

    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    He liked it, my boss did as well and the network was willing to pay for its
    production. Here is the final result:

      Now, I think that this idea ended up falling short. It lacked the
      business aspect of the equation (i.e providing loans or opening saving
      accounts for the vendors) and as a PR move it never really exploded since
      there were no other mediums strengthening our message.
