      <i>In general, because I'm keen to work with projects that have an impact
        on people's life. But more concretely, I'm showing this case because of
        the way we manage to simplify a very complex subject and the decisions that we took
        in order to define our scope.</i>

      To solve the brief, we opted to have our own version of a tech-first
      approach. Meaning that we first chose a product and then we thought about
      the opportunities that were present in its related field or outside of it.
      <br><br>
      We agreed to go with Nintendo Labo and tackle video game epilepsy.
      We tried different angles and we raised questions such as, should we
      focus on preventive or reactive behavior? Or where are we aiming?
      Helping patients with their symptoms or physicians with the treatment?
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
      Questions kept popping up, therefore we decided to frame the brief
      around one of the most urgent subjects of epilepsy: silent symptoms.
      We asked ourselves:
    </p>
    <h3 class="question">
    <i> How might we enable early detection of epilepsy in children?</i>
    </h3>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    The first half of that answer, came to us after researching about EEG sensors
    and how they are being used in mind gaming. Specifically, it came to us after
    finding that EEG sensors are also used in brain scans for epilepsy.</p>
    <p class="text-justify port-text">
    Here is the other half of our solution:

    <ul class="list">

      I believe our idea was preventive at its core, in a way that involved
      the main actors around the subject and it cater to their specific needs:
      Kids could enjoy their games, parents gained more control over an
      unpredictable matter and physicians could finally have a starting point
      to work with.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img  class="written-titles"src="illustrations/learnings.png" alt="title" data-aos="zoom-in-up">
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
      From a brand perspective, perhaps this was not the smartest move,
      in a sense that Nintendo would take a lot of risk for an uncertain
      reward. Even more, there's the chance that parents would end their
      cycle as Nintendo's customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, I believe we lacked information about how mind gaming happens
        and how to implement this hybrid type of game flow in a seamless way.
      </li>
